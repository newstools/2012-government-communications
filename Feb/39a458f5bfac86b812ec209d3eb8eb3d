14 February 2012Cabinet held its ordinary meeting in Cape Town on 8 February 2012.1.1 Cabinet calls on all South Africans to be more responsible on the roads given the high road carnage over the festive period. An unacceptably high number people died on the country's roads from 1 December 2011 to 10 January 2012. In line with the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, government is going all out to ensure safer roads. Measures include the introduction of road safety education as part of the life skills curriculum at schools, legislative amendments to ensure that dangerous drivers are removed from the roads as well as a revised road safety strategy 2012-2015. Cabinet wants 2012 to be the year of action against those who seek to turn our roads into killing fields. 1.2 Cabinet congratulates matriculants who have completed matric and have progressed into higher learning institutions and encourages those who did not succeed not to despair but to try harder this year.
