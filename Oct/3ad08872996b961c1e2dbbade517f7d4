11 October 2012Cabinet held its ordinary meeting in Pretoria on 10 October 2012 (yesterday), and, in keeping with established practices, we hereby conduct this briefing to give an account on issues noted and decisions taken, as follows:1. Current affairs1.1 EconomyCabinet noted with concern the uncomfortable international macro-economic outlook, of which South Africa is not left unaffected, due to global factors but also domestic ones, as a result of which rating agencies altered our standing from stable to negative.Cabinet remains committed to taking the necessary measures to lift the growth potential and competitiveness of the South African economy, to address the domestic contributory factors and to ensure that the impact of the downgrade is contained and does not encroach on already constrained resources for key service delivery programmes.It should be noted that as a country, we take seriously the role of agencies and that, as always, we view them as necessary partners to do assessments of who we and reflect on the areas we should pay attention to as an International actor on matters of economy.1.2. LabourCabinet noted with concerns the lawlessness, violence and intimidation that continue to pollute the otherwise democratic right for workers to strike. It is a fact that as a Democracy, the right to strike is a defined right in South Africa that obligates the strikers to observe that they cannot encroach into other peoples' rights as they enjoy theirs. No one should be intimidated to take or not to take an industrial action in a Democracy. No one should resort to any form of violence against people or property as a form of striking or protests.Our struggle for freedom and democracy ensured that our laws provide a space for protected peaceful strikes, which obviates the need for illegal strikes accompanied by violence and intimidation.Cabinet therefore reiterates its call for workers to utilise existing channels with unions to address grievance and wage negotiations in a manner that is in touch with our laws and collective bargaining practices.It is, among others, these illegal strike actions and the accompanying violence that is not helping the country's image internationally and is contributing to the already exerting challenges facing our economy and society.1.3 Presidential Infrastructure Development SummitCabinet noted that there is a Presidential Infrastructure Summit planned for the 19th October 2012 that will boost the visibility of government's infrastructure plan, driven by the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission.1.4 EducationCabinet noted that President Zuma handed over new schools to villages in Libode and Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape as part of the replacement programme for mud schools.Cabinet wishes the Class of 2012 well with the 2012 National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations which will be written from 22 October until 28 November 2012.1.5. HealthGovernment has put in place early interventions to address health barriers to learning in order to enhance children's development and educational gains. Preventable and treatable barriers such as problems with vision, hearing and oral health can compromise children's ability to achieve to their full potential.On this programme, President Jacob Zuma is launching the Integrated School Health Package today 11 October at Chokwe School in Cullinan.The Integrated School Health Programme is a joint initiative between the departments of Basic Education, Health and Social Development that delivers a comprehensive package of both onsite health education and services to primary and secondary schools.1.6 Salute to a national heroThe last week saw a great loss to South Africa's intellettual community with the death of Zwelakhe Sisulu, the son of Walter and Albertina Sisulu, and a contributor to the freedom struggle in his own right.Cabinet expresses its condolences to the family and friends of this giant of South Africa's history.Mr Sisulu will be remembered with pride for the role played at the New Nation newspaper, the SABC and other institutions, as well as the inspiration he gave to many youth and families.1.7 SAA BoardCabinet has noted with concern the developments that have unfolded with the resignation of the CEO and some of the executive management of the national carrier South African Airways (SAA) .This comes at a point when the Minister of Public Enterprises is finalising the development of the sustainable long term vision for the national carrier.CABINET DECISIONS2.1 Accession to the United Nations lnternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)Cabinet approved that South Africa accede to the United Nations International Covenant on Economic and Cultural Rights.
