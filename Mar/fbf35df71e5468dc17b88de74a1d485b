14 March 2012Mr Obed Bapela, Deputy Minister in the Presidency for Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, will today officially launch the GCIS-produced Public Sector Manager Magazine (PSM). PSM is a business-to-business magazine that allows public sector managers to be profiled and acquire information about government policies and programmes. The magazine forms part of GCIS s communication strategy and addresses the information needs of one of government s target audiences, namely managers in the Public Service. Public sector managers' understanding of government policies and programme is vital for success in service delivery and leading the country at large. The content mix is built around interviews with Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Directors-General and senior officials, while the publication also includes various leisure, personal growth and lifestyle elements that provide content variety and appeals to the need among public sectors to strike a balance between professional pressures and personal fulfillment. As part of extending the magazine brand and the underlying value of the publication as a communication platform, GCIS has also launched monthly interactive sessions under the title Public Sector Manager Forum. The Forum allows senior leadershipfeatured in the magazine to interact personally and frankly with public sector managers, who are invited to pose questions and make suggestions. This brings the national leadership in touch with a key sector entrusted with ensuring that government and the country function effectively. Members of the media are invited to attend this evening's launch, details for which are as follows: Date: Wednesday, 14 March 2012 Time: 18h30 for 19h00 Venue: Sandton Convention Centre, Maud Street, Sandton To confirm attendance sms your name and the name of the organisation you represent to 082 413 4609.
