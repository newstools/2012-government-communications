28 August 2012The Chairperson of The Motsepe Foundation (TMF), Dr Precious Moloi-Motsepe is hosting a breakfast meeting with stakeholders to update and outline progress made since the launch of the Women and Budget Initiative, now known as the Gender Responsive Budget Initiative .The Gender Responsive Budget Initiative (GRBI) is a South African women s empowerment programme spearheaded by the Women s Desk of The Motsepe Foundation (TMF) in collaboration with the Department of Women, Children, and People with Disabilities (DWPD) with technical assistance from the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). The Minister of DWPD, Ms Lulu Xingwana will deliver the keynote address. Members of the media are invited as follows: Date: Wednesday, 29 August 2012 Time: 08h00 Venue: Hilton Hotel, 138 Rivonia Road, Sandton The programme, which was launched in February 2012, seeks to strengthen the capacity of government and other stakeholders (planners, policy-makers, gender focal groups, civil society and women s organisations) to review, analyse and prepare plans and budgets that ensure that the needs of women are specifically and equally addressed. TMF has since conducted research in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Trade and Industry, Health and Energy sectors. The preliminary findings of the research will be tabled at the breakfast event for discussion by all stakeholders. Having a gender-sensitive budget will enable poorer communities (where the effects of inequality, unemployment and poverty most affect the majority of women and girls in South Africa) to identify their most pressing economic needs.
